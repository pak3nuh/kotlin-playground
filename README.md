# kotlin-playground
Playground to learn kotlin much like kotlin koans.

The main idea is to provide a hands-on environment where we can read a bit of documentation
and experiment with it with IDE support.

## Structure
The project is structured into packages that should be straightforward to follow.
For instance the package `io.github.pak3nuh.kotlin.playground.basics` contains the
language basic blocks that one should know first.

Inside each package there is an order to where the content should be read for consistency.

It is normal that some proposed exercises touch into subjects that weren't introduced
yet, but it is borderline impossible to make useful and compilable examples without those
subjects. This is mainly true in the first basic chapters.

### Testing (TODO)
Because gamification is a very powerful engagement tool, I plan to have tests for every
proposed exercise whenever possible, meaning that correctness is an important part of
the journey too.
